# Everwing-Hacks

It's nice to see that the Everwing Game made some changes to block hacks... Now we can mostly complain about the spam messages it sends to our friends. This was a project with console codes and an extension for the popular Everwing game.

You may try a forks of this project, like [Everwing-Hacks-Reloaded-Extension](https://github.com/0x4754/Everwing-Hacks-Reloaded-Extension) that seems to work.
